My name is Xavier Luboviski, I believe that with a little hard work and determination anything is possible. I was raised in Oakland Ca and currently attend the University of Hawaii Manoa. I am a senior with hopes of going into product management after college or a similar field. I have experience in tableau, SQL, BigQuary, Salesforce, Microsoft Office, Monday, and Engaging Networks. I am looking for an internship that will challenge me and further my technical skills.
